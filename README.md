# Sine-Wave-Inversion
C++ Code for Sine Wave Inversion

This is a code for sine waveform inversion for parameters like amplitude, frequency, phase and dc component.

It uses ALGLIB (http://www.alglib.net/) library for for data objects and parameter optimization.

y = A*cos(2*pi*f*t+p)+d

A is the amplitude
f is the frequency
p is the phase
d is the dc component

y is the sine wave form as a function of time.
